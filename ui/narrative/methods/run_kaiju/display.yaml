parameters :
	input_reads_ref :
		ui-name : |
			Read library (or Set) object <font color=red>*</font>
		short-hint : |
			The read library or read library set to examine
		long-hint  : |
			The read library or read library set for which you want to trim.
	output_biom_name :
		ui-name : |
			Output library (or Set) name <font color=red>*</font>
		short-hint : |
			Base name for output read library or read library set object
		long-hint : |
			Base name for output read library or read library set object
	tax_levels :
		ui-name : |
			Adapters
		short-hint : |
			The reference sequences for trimming.
		long-hint : |
			The reference adapter sequences.
	db_type : 
		ui-name : |
			Seed mismatches
		short-hint : |
			Maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full match.
		long-hint : |
			Specifies the maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full match to be performed.
	seg_filter : 
		ui-name : |
			Palindrome clip threshold
		short-hint : |
			Specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads must be for PE palindrome read alignment.
		long-hint : |
			Specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads must be for PE palindrome read alignment.
	min_match_length :
		ui-name : |
			Sliding window size
		short-hint : |
			Specifies the number of bases to average across.
		long-hint : |
			Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high quality data later in the read.
	greedy_run_mode : 
		ui-name : |
			Simple clip threshold
		short-hint : |
			Specifies how accurate the match between any adapter etc. sequence must be against a read.
		long-hint : |
			Specifies how accurate the match between any adapter etc. sequence must be against a read.
	greedy_min_match_score :
		ui-name : |
			Sliding window minimum quality
		short-hint : |
			Specifies the average quality required.
		long-hint : |
			Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high quality data later in the read.
	greedy_allowed_mismatches :
		ui-name : |
			Post Tail Crop length
		short-hint : |
			The number of bases to keep, from the start of the read (e.g. tail crop 10 bases from a 150 base read: enter "140").
		long-hint : |
			Removes bases regardless of quality from the end of the read, so that the read has maximally the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might of course further shorten the read.
